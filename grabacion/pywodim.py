#
#	Pywodim is a Python module for burning an ISO file to disc using wodim
#	Most of the heavy lifting is done by the following linux programs:
#	
#	wodim   - does the actual burningstring.find(args[numArgs-1], "-", 0, 1)
#	md5sum  - verifies data integrity
#	mount   - checks for disc mount
#	eject   - opens/closes drive tray
#	volname - gets the disc's volume name
#	mount	- for testing the status of a device mount
#	grep	- for determining certain output results
#
#	PyWodim also makes extensive use of the Linux CD-ROM
#	standard as described in /usr/include/linux/cdrom.h
#	in order to talk to the drive and query its status
#	via ioctl commands.
